## 📖 About The Project

The **Field Force Management System (FFMS)** is an end-to-end platform designed for organizations to seamlessly manage their distributed mobile workforce. It offers powerful real-time tracking, attendance logging, dynamic geofencing, robust task management, and deep analytical insights, all wrapped in a premium, role-based user interface.

Whether you're managing a small local team or a massive regional sales force, FFMS acts as your central command center, bridging the gap between field agents and administrative managers.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📍 **Real-Time Live Tracking:** Monitor field staff on a live map with dynamic GPS polling, battery indicators, and speed metrics.
- 🛡️ **Geofencing & Territories:** Create custom polygon boundaries and receive automated breach/safety alerts when agents enter or leave designated zones.
- ⏱️ **Attendance & Selfies:** Automated shift logging (check-in/check-out) featuring real-time location capture and mandatory photo verifications.
- 📝 **Task & Route Management:** Assign daily tasks and intelligent routes to specific agents and track real-time completion statuses.
- 🔔 **Real-Time Live Feed & Notifications:** Socket-driven notifications system keeping managers instantly updated on activities and anomalies.
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** Detailed performance graphs, attendance rates, project monitoring, and custom data scopes per management level.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct dashboards and isolated data environments for **Admins**, **Managers**, and **Field Staff**.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **PostgreSQL** (Local or Cloud instance like Neon)
- **Redis** Server (Running locally on port 6379 or remote)
- **Flutter SDK** (for the mobile application)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thesis-Tech/Field_Force_Mnt_Sys.git
   cd Field_Force_Mnt_Sys
   ```

2. **Backend Setup (`FFMS_NANDINI`):**
   ```bash
   cd FFMS_NANDINI/backend
   npm install
   
   # Set up your .env file based on .env.example
   # Required: DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT=5000
   
   # Run Database Migrations
   npm run db:migrate
   
   # Start the Backend Server (Dev Mode)
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup (`FFMS_FRONTEND_ADIT`):**
   ```bash
   cd ../../FFMS_FRONTEND_ADIT/frontend
   npm install
   
   # Set up your .env.local file
   # Required: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
   
   # Start the Frontend Server
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Mobile App Setup (`ffms_mobile`):**
   ```bash
   cd ../../ffms_mobile
   flutter pub get
   
   # Run on an emulator or connected device
   flutter run
   ```

## 🔒 Environment Variables

To properly run the application, you need to configure your environment variables. 

### Backend (`.env`)
```env
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ffms?schema=public"
REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1d"
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET="your_refresh_token_secret"
CLOUDINARY_URL="cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name"
```

### Frontend (`.env.local`)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api/v1"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPPLS_TOKEN="your_mappls_api_token_here"
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Client Layer:** 
   - Web application consumed by Admins and Managers for monitoring and configurations.
   - Flutter application consumed by field agents to submit real-time logs, statuses, and geodata.
2. **Gateway / API Layer:** Node.js Express server handling authentication, validation, and RESTful routing.
3. **Event Engine:** Real-time WebSockets powered by Socket.io pushing live coordinates and alerts from agents to dashboards.
4. **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma) ensuring ACID compliance and Redis holding ephemeral coordinates, acting as an event broker for BullMQ.
5. **Background Processors:** BullMQ queues process heavy workloads like batch coordinate writes, email notifications, and report generation without blocking the main event loop.
